This is a universal "Freecam" plugin for UEVR that I built in my spare time.  
It should work with most UE4/UE5 games.  
In addition to Freecam, this plugin also includes a screenshot feature—but instead of using the game’s built-in capture functions, it simply relies on Windows’ `Win + PrtSc` shortcut.

**To install this plugin is very simple:**
- Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/mirudo2/UEVR-Freecam-by-Polar/releases)
- Extract it anywhere
- Copy the folders, `plugins` and `scripts` to: `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\UnrealVRMod\<GAME PROFILE FOLDER>`.
> Tip: if you are not seeing the **AppData** folder, it means that it is hidden. Just enable/show hidden files and folders in the `Explorer` settings.

**In game:**
- Double click with `R3`, to activate/deactivate Freecam mode.
- Double click with `L3`, to take a screenshot. (Image saved in your Windows pictures folder)

You can also use `LT` (Camera Up) and `RT` (Dash) while moving the camera.
